# Socket-Programming
In this project, we will be creating three programs, two client programs and one server program. The aim is to have firsthand experiencing with creating sockets and sending data through a TCP connection. We will be sending a C struct from our first client that has a character, integer, and floating number to the server. Then, it will modify these values and be sent to the 2nd client which will print it then terminate the connection. We will be using the Jason server as our server, the Volta server as our first client, and a Ubuntu machine running in virtual machine as our 2nd client.
